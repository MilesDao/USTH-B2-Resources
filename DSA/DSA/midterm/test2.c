/*

The appropriate data structure is a Queue because the chat app must display
messages in the same order they arrive (FIFO). Queue naturally supports this
behavior.

Basic functions:
- enqueue(x)
- dequeue()
- front()
- isEmpty()

Complexity:
Displaying all messages requires n dequeue operations → O(n).
