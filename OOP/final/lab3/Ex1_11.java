class Ex1_11 {
    // ex 1:
    // one parent => 11 child
    // multiple inheritance A -> B->C
    // 1 p -> many child
    // 1 c -> many parent
    // Multiple inheritance of classes is not allowed

    // //Inheritance (“is-a”)

    // A child class extends a parent class.
    // Example: Dog extends Animal.

    // Composition (“has-a”)

    // A class contains another object as part of its structure.
    // Example: Car has an Engine.

    // 7. Concept of polymorphism. Why do we care?
    // Polymorphism

    // Same method name, but the behavior depends on the object.

    // Animal a = new Dog();
    // a.sound();
    // The call resolves to Dog’s implementation.

     * 10. Concept of abstraction. How do we obtain it in Java?
     * Abstraction
     * 
     * Showing essential features while hiding unnecessary details.
     * 
     * Example:
     * You use a car without knowing how the engine works internally.
